Here is the link of google colab of Road Pattern Recognition using KNN: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FcMR_xqYCv93owh6rMZ2u-4PgTt3ZH0G?usp=sharing

File Descriptions:

1. Data written in the code is just dummy data, in reality i want to use solar-powered car to record the track. So the data can be assumed track of vehicle that pass through
2. KNN_RoadPattern.ipynb contains full code using python language
3. Road_KNN.pdf contains detail informations about full code
4. Road Recognition.png is visualisation of final results
5. The accuracy is 100% because it is not using KNN for classified several class.
